<!-- Write a JavaScript program to input sides of a triangle and check whether a triangle is equilateral, scalene or isosceles triangle using if else.
Properties of triangle:
A triangle is said Equilateral Triangle, if all its sides are equal. If a, b, c are three sides of triangle. Then, the triangle is equilateral only if a == b == c.
 A triangle is said Isosceles Triangle, if its two sides are equal. If a, b, c are three sides of triangle. Then, the triangle is isosceles if either a == b or a == c or b == c.
 A triangle is said Scalene Triangle, if none of its sides are equal. -->
